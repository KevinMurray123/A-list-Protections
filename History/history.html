            A-List Protections was founded by John Windsor, in 1936 in the small town of Buckeye, New York. When crime rates were at an all time high, the need for protection was vital. New Jersy was a hotspot for criminal activity, and higher ups such as politicians, buisnessmen, and famous actors of that time needed that security to fully perform their daily activities and routines.<br><br>The firm has undergone several changes throughout the years, as society progressed and technology improved. The changes include a change of the firm name, and when historical events occured, A-List Protection became an equal employment opportunity employer.<br><br>By the time the 1990's rolled around, John Windsor hired his daughter, who became the CEO and since then, Eleanore Windsor has been maintaining its integrity and respect from many other agencies.<br><br>A-List Protection has been keeping its promise to clients for secure protection with discreet security. We hope we can provide that for you through our services.
